- [Reuse Page Ribbon Actions (PageStateCommands) Outside the Ribbon · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/762/): This week I searched for a solution to reuse the page action buttons from the ribbon (Edit Page, Check In, Publish) in a page layout. It was a request of a client that wanted to make the page actions available on the page itself, so that it simplifies the creation/editing/publication process for the users.

- [Deploy your Azure Functions as a package from GitHub Actions · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/deploy-azure-functions-package-github-actions/): For Squarl, I started to implement a couple of improvements for the back-end running on Azure Functions. I created these functions with TypeScript. In the past, I used webpack and later Azure Funcpack to bundle my functions to one file per function.

- [To write code comments or not, it should not be a question · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/write-code-comments-or-not-should-not-be-question/): Comments, just do it. I write this post because I read a couple of articles, and messages on social platforms about stop using comments in your code. In some cases, there is good reasoning behind it, but even with this reasoning, I believe that comments are too valuable for your DEV team.

## Devhack-azure-cdn-sas-verizon-premium

- [#DevHack: Using Azure CDN with SAS on Verizon Premium · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/devhack-azure-cdn-sas-verizon-premium/): In the previous article, I explained how you could use the Shared Access Signature (SAS) in Cloudflare. The reason that I use this approach is to make sure the Azure Storage cannot be publicly accessed. Only via a SAS token blobs can be retrieved or updated. If you want to do this for Azure CDN, I pointed to the documentation to configure this, but it seems that it has changed a bit over time.

During the testing of Cloudflare, I found out that CORS headers were not present for the files. Usually, this is not needed if you only retrieve one file, but if you want to retrieve another file, for instance, a template from your site, these cross-origin resource sharing headers are required.

## Devhack-cloudflare-cdn-azure-storage-caching

- [#DevHack: Use Cloudflare CDN for your Azure Storage caching · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/devhack-cloudflare-cdn-azure-storage-caching/): Getting your files faster to your clients is very important.

## Devhack-simple-caching-node-js-azure-functions

- [#DevHack: Simple caching in Node.js Azure Functions · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/devhack-simple-caching-node-js-azure-functions/): Azure Functions do not have an out-of-the-box caching mechanism. For caching, the recommended way would be to use a distributed cache like Azure Cache or Redis. These services each come with their price tag and might be too robust for the cache you want to create or need.
For Azure Function created with C#, you can use the good old memory cache.

Most of the time, I would change the primary colors, but that was all. Why would you change something which works fine?

- [PnP Virtual Conference: Start UI testing your solutions · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/pnp-virtual-conference-start-ui-testing-solutions/): On the first of September 2020, the PnP team organized its first virtual conference. The conference had lots of great sessions, and I am sure you would have had a hard time picking the sessions you wanted to follow. You know what they say, choosing is losing. Actually, that is not true.

## Parse-multipart-form-data-azure-function

- [Parse multipart/form-data in Azure Function · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/parse-multipart-form-data-azure-function/): While working on an internal Azure Static Web Site project, I needed to upload CSV files to an Azure Function to import data to Cosmos DB.
When uploading a file to your API, the multipart/form-data content-type is used. The body’s format looks a bit “special” as it requires some parsing to get each file.

## Picked-cypress-selenium

- [Why I picked Cypress over Selenium · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/picked-cypress-selenium/): For the PnP Virtual Conference, I did a talk about how to start with UI testing. During the session, someone asked me why my preference is Cypress and not Selenium. As the session was only 30 minutes, it is hard to fit every bits and piece in it. That is the intention of this article to tell you why we are using Cypress.

## Retrieving-the-cosmos-db-query-continuation-token-with-node-js

- [Retrieving the CosmosDB query continuation token in Node.js · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/retrieving-the-cosmos-db-query-continuation-token-with-node-js/): For one of our internal tools at Valo, I am creating a portal for managing our project localizations. The portal itself will be produced as a static website and hosted on Azure Static Web App. The great thing about Azure Static Web Apps is that it comes with hosting and the ability to create Azure Functions.

## Parse-application-www-form-urlencoded-form-data-azure-function

- [Parse application/x-www-form-urlencoded in Azure Function · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/parse-application-www-form-urlencoded-form-data-azure-function/): For a Mailchimp webhook, I had to parse the application/x-www-form-urlencoded form data to JSON. Azure Functions does not automatically do this for you, so you have to provide your parser. I knew that I had already done this, so I went on a search journey through my code.
To make it easier next time, I wanted to share the code snippet with the rest of you.

## Netlify-vs-vercel-vs-azure-static-web-app

- [Which service? Netlify vs Vercel vs Azure Static Web App · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/netlify-vs-vercel-vs-azure-static-web-app/): I like to use static websites. It is fun to see that so many go back to the “old” way of working, but still try to find our ways to add our content dynamically.
Retro tech is hip again
Last year I made my move to static with my blog, which is now running on the Azure Storage static website option and powered by Hugo and do not regret it.

## Manual-github-workflow-triggers-azure-static-web-site

- [Manual GitHub workflow triggers for Azure Static Web Site · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/manual-github-workflow-triggers-azure-static-web-site/): In July 2020, GitHub released a new manual trigger feature for its GitHub Actions workflows. This trigger allows you to run a workflow from the UI, or you can also use it to run it via an HTTP POST request. The HTTP POST request option makes it very useful to trigger your workflow to run from an external system.

## Local-azure-static-web-app-development-easier

- [How to make local Azure Static Web App development easier · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/local-azure-static-web-app-development-easier/): Static sites are cool again (actually for a long time), and Microsoft knows that. Their new Azure Static Web App - App Service is currently in preview. At the moment, it still misses some key functionalities, but I am sure that these will get added once they put it in GA (hopefully to be announced at Ignite in September 2020).

## E2e-testing-microsoft-teams-solutions-cypress

- [End-to-End testing your Microsoft Teams solutions with Cypress · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/e2e-testing-microsoft-teams-solutions-cypress/): For a long time, I was looking for a way to start end-to-end test solutions in Microsoft Teams. The easiest way to start running these tests is against the web experience (https://teams.microsoft.com). That way, we can use tools like Cypress. Another reason to do these E2E tests with Cypress is that internally we use Cypress for all our E2E tests.

## Utility-functions-install-extra-dependencies-sharepoint-framework

- [Utility functions which you might not know existed in SPFx · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/utility-functions-install-extra-dependencies-sharepoint-framework/): Utility/helper functions, every project uses them, but how do you get them to your projects. For our products, we use a common/shared library private npm package. By sharing this package to all our products, we do not have to reinvent the wheel every time, but also have to fix things in one place when there is a bug.

## Ignoring-json-comment-errors-spfx-solutions

- [Ignoring the JSON comment errors in your SPFx solutions · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/ignoring-json-comment-errors-spfx-solutions/): Something that bothers me for a long time is the comments in the SharePoint Framework component JSON manifest files. As you may know, JSON does not allow you to add comments to its content. Visual Studio Code will show some errors for it as well.
VSCode comment errors in JSON I understand that comments are needed.

## Uses

- [My setup: get to know what I use · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/uses/): Get to know what I use on a daily basis in my office to get most of my work done. In this article I share all hardware/software I use.

## My-review-of-the-jabra-evolve2-85-headset

- [My review of the Jabra Evolve2 85 headset · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/my-review-of-the-jabra-evolve2-85-headset/): For three months, I have waited for the Jabra Evolve2 85 to show up. During the Corona crisis, I needed a new headset to filter out all the noise my kids make at home, so that I could 100% focus on my work. A colleague told me about this headset. When I ordered it, it was not even out yet but was soon to be released.

## Developing-share-point-framework-solutions-outside-the-workbench

- [Developing SharePoint Framework solutions outside the workbench · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/developing-share-point-framework-solutions-outside-the-workbench/): I do not know how many times you use the workbench, but I rarely use it. It is not that I do not like it, as the workbench is useful, but I want to be able to test my solutions in “real” pages. This way, I can see how everything comes together.

## Stream-deck-review-people-stream-macos-extensibility

- [Stream Deck review for people who do not play games or stream and use macOS · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/stream-deck-review-people-stream-macos-extensibility/): During the Corona crisis, most of us had to work from home. One of the devices I saw people making a lot of fuss about was the Elgato Stream Deck. As the name suggests, it intends to make streaming easier to give you a set of buttons you can use for quickly triggering actions.

## Ringing-your-doorbell-on-your-sonos-speakers

- [Ringing the doorbell on your Sonos speakers · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/ringing-your-doorbell-on-your-sonos-speakers/): Ringing your doorbell on your Sonos speakers
Ding dong!!! Earlier this week, I changed my old doorbell to the Eufy video doorbell. When it arrived and wanted to install it, I found out that my current wiring with the intercom system was not supported. Luckily the doorbell has a battery, so instead of running on power coming from the old wires, it will run on the battery for six months.

## Preserving-whitelisting-sharepoint-authentication-cookies-running-e2e-testing-cypress

- [Preserving and whitelisting SharePoint authentication cookies while running E2E testing with Cypress · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/preserving-whitelisting-sharepoint-authentication-cookies-running-e2e-testing-cypress/): In the previous article, I explained how you could trick Cypress and SharePoint to load the whole page instead of a page on which most of the SharePoint controls did not load.
Related article: How to make your site believe it isn’t running in an iframe during Cypress E2E tests.

## Tests-running-iframe-cypress-e2e-tests

- [How to make your site believe it isn't running in an iframe during Cypress E2E tests · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/tests-running-iframe-cypress-e2e-tests/): Cypress is a fantastic front end testing tool but has one major limitation. I already blogged about it a while ago. The limitation is that it runs all tests within an iframe. This iframe approach makes sense, as it allows the tool to show the running tests and the page in one view.

## Things-which-only-happen-just-before-you-are-about-to-release

- [Things which only happen just before you are about to release · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/things-which-only-happen-just-before-you-are-about-to-release/): Hey team, are we ready to release? Yes, push the button and ship it. Why are all our tests failing? Why are our builds crashing? Why can I not access our services? Sounds familiar? It seems to be a common issue when you are just about to release your solution/project/product/…

## Cypress-test-sharepoint-solution-azure-ad-secured-api

- [How to use Cypress to test your SharePoint solution with an Azure AD-secured API · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/cypress-test-sharepoint-solution-azure-ad-secured-api/): How to use Cypress to test your SharePoint solution with an Azure AD-secured API
In January 2020, I explained my approach to how you can make use of Cypress to test out your SharePoint solutions. Cypress is great to use and simple to configure. I like the capability of running individual tests on your local machine to verify if the solution is still working as expected once you implemented changes, and do full runs after nightly builds.

## Diy-building-busy-light-show-microsoft-teams-presence

- [DIY: Building a busy light to show your Microsoft Teams presence · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/diy-building-busy-light-show-microsoft-teams-presence/): For many of us, working from home is mandatory these days. For me, nothing major changed. I was already used to work from home since I joined Valo 2,5 years ago.
One thing that has changed is that my children are now at home while I am working. Luckily I was prepared for it (I thought).

## Running-azure-devops-hosted-agent-wsl

- [Running an Azure DevOps self-hosted agent on WSL · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/running-azure-devops-hosted-agent-wsl/): Some time ago, I migrated my blog from Wordpress to a static site by Hugo. To generate the static pages, I make use of Azure DevOps pipelines. The free tier, which gives me up to 1800 minutes/month, is enough, but not this month. When I wanted to publish my blog post from yesterday, I got the following friendly message:

## Conditional-publish-packages-npm-github-actions

- [Conditional publish packages to NPM via GitHub actions · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/conditional-publish-packages-npm-github-actions/): While I was working on one of my hobby projects to automate our home with Homebridge, I wanted to have an easy way to publish my packages to NPM. I usually do this via Azure DevOps, but as one of the conditions to get the plugin verified is that it is published publically on GitHub, I wanted to give GitHub Actions a try.

## Multilingual-apis-modern-sharepoint

- [Using the new multilingual APIs in Modern SharePoint · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/multilingual-apis-modern-sharepoint/): Currently, the Multilingual page publishing for Modern SharePoint feature is rolling out to first-release tenants. This feature allows you to create pages on communications sites in different languages. These pages get linked to each other, and with a language switcher, you can navigate from language variant to variant.

## Showing-spinner-dynamically-loading-resources-spfx-property-pane

- [Showing a spinner when dynamically loading resources for your SPFx property pane · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/showing-spinner-dynamically-loading-resources-spfx-property-pane/): In your SharePoint Framework web parts, you have the option to load resources dynamically. These resources could be data you want to fetch or dynamically load controls before the property pane panel gets shown. To achieve this, you implement the logic in the loadPropertyPaneResources method.
Info: You can find more information about dynamically loading controls here: Special property pane dynamic loading.

## Utilize-playwright-jest-cross-browser-e2e-test-solutions

- [Utilize Playwright together with Jest to cross-browser E2E test your solutions · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/utilize-playwright-jest-cross-browser-e2e-test-solutions/): On my journey to select the best tool for our end-to-end tests for our teams, I tested out the recently announced Playwright tool from Microsoft. This tool is the new version of Puppeteer (as the core team members moved to Microsoft).
Info: The benefits of E2E tests are that it validates if your features work (or keep working when implementing changes), and also provides a more code-driven approach of documenting the features and user flows.

## Running-cypress-azure-devops-cross-browser-testing-solutions

- [Running Cypress on Azure DevOps for cross-browser testing your solutions · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/running-cypress-azure-devops-cross-browser-testing-solutions/): In my journey, selecting the best tool to automate the end-to-end tests for our products, I had been testing out Cypress for a while. Cypress is just a fantastic tool. It is easy to set up, documentation is up to date, and it makes it easy to verify features/implementations with its UI.

## Quick-tip-dynamic-variable-groups-azure-devops-yaml-pipelines

- [Quick tip: How to use dynamic variable groups in Azure DevOps YAML pipelines · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/quick-tip-dynamic-variable-groups-azure-devops-yaml-pipelines/): The preferred way to implement pipelines these days in Azure DevOps is via YAML. Which makes the pipeline part of your code and is automatically version controlled.
When you were used to the classic way of creating release pipelines, you might have used environment scoped variables. These scoped variables were great to specify to which environments you wanted to provision/install/deploy/… your solutions.

## Best-practice-local-sharepoint-results-source-id-gain-search-control

- [Best practice: specify the Local SharePoint results source ID to gain search control · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/best-practice-local-sharepoint-results-source-id-gain-search-control/): When creating solutions based on SharePoint search, you best always define the source ID of the Local SharePoint results source with each call. By providing that source ID with each request, you make sure that the results you expect for your solutions are always the same.
Which ID? The Local SharePoint results source ID you are looking for is: 8413cd39-2156-4e00-b54d-11efd9abdb89.

- [Why does your timer trigger Azure Function run at unforeseen times? · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/timer-trigger-azure-function-run-unforeseen-times-/): Why does your timer trigger Azure Function run at unforeseen times?
Has it ever happened that your timer triggered Azure Function was running on unforeseen times? We had it for two functions, and could not immediately find out where or why this was triggered more than once an hour.
Timer function running multiple times per hour One of the functions should run once every hour, but as you can see, sometimes it runs more.

## Cypress-testing-sharepoint-solutions

- [Using Cypress for end to end testing your SharePoint solutions · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/cypress-testing-sharepoint-solutions/): Last year I already wrote an article about how you could implement visual UI tests for your SharePoint solutions by using Puppeteer in combination with Jest. I still use these tools for setting up various UI tests in our products, but a couple of months ago, a tool called Cypress caught my attention.

## Recap-2019-a-year-full-of-lessons

- [Sometimes you just have to learn to let go - 2019 a year full of lessons · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/recap-2019-a-year-full-of-lessons/): WHAT A YEAR! This year was a personal rollercoaster. I would have never thought 2019 would be so hard, fun, crazy, and filled with a lot of life lessons.
Rollercoaster What happened in 2019? Initially, I told myself to do less travel in 2019, only attend a couple of events and focus a bit more on product development, family, and hobbies.

## Retrieving-image-focal-point-sharepoint-modern-page

- [Retrieving the image its focal point of a SharePoint Modern page · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/retrieving-image-focal-point-sharepoint-modern-page/): On SharePoint modern pages, you can set the focal point of the header image. Having this kind of control is excellent for creating compelling pages.
Header image with focal point What if you also want to make use of the same focal point in your roll-ups? Luckily this is also possible, and it depends a bit on how you retrieve the data.

- [Why it is important to keep the version in sync when using the library component in SharePoint Framework · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/important-version-sync-library-component-sharepoint-framework/): A couple of months ago, I moved a couple of my projects to make use of the library component in SharePoint Framework. The library component allows you to share common logic between your projects. Sharing code through your projects is having many benefits like smaller bundle sizes, more comfortable to fix bugs, no code duplication, …

- [Aborting your fetch requests in your SharePoint Framework extensions during navigation events · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/aborting-fetch-requests-spfx-extensions-navigation-events/): Once again an article about navigation events. This time it has nothing to do with checks you need to implement to know when or to which page you navigated. This time it is about canceling/aborting API calls which your browser performs while navigating to another page. Most likely you can cancel these calls because they do no longer matter for the current page.

## Speed-sharepoint-framework-builds-wsl-2

- [Speed up SharePoint Framework builds with WSL 2 · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/speed-sharepoint-framework-builds-wsl-2/): SharePoint Framework builds very fast on new projects, but once you start adding more components or functionality, the builds quickly get slower. In our codebase, we tried to split up projects as much as possible, so that fewer components need to be built during your development cycle. As much as it helps with some projects, we still have two slow projects.

## Handling-page-creation-events-spfx-application-customizer

- [Handling page creation events in your SPFx application customizer · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/handling-page-creation-events-spfx-application-customizer/): Some time ago I wrote about things to check in your SharePoint Framework application customizer for making sure it behaves correctly on navigation events. This included checks to see if you navigated to another page, different hub site and site with another language.
In most cases, these are the checks that you want to put in place, to make sure that your application customizer renders the right data after a navigation event.

## Sfpx-library-component-simplifying-localization-experience

- [Using the SFPx library component for simplifying the localization experience · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/sfpx-library-component-simplifying-localization-experience/): One of the things hardest things when creating and maintaining a product is localization. It requires a lot of testing, validation and follow-up. In SharePoint Framework projects it is no different, maybe even a bit harder, as the localization files are created per component. This means that you might have to take care of duplicate localization keys and labels.

- [The challenges of migrating my Wordpress site to Hugo · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/the-challenges-of-migrating-my-wordpress-site-to-hugo/): After almost three years, I finally made my over to a static site generated by Hugo. From the moment I started blogging in 2010, I used Wordpress. Wordpress was the best option back then. As the hosting company which I used only supported PHP, and I also got into coding by learning PHP when I was a student.

- [Homepages on Sharepoint all share the same unique ID · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/homepages-sharepoint-all-share-the-same-unique-id/): It appears that some time ago (weeks/months), the unique ID of a SharePoint homepage is not unique anymore and is shared with other homepages pages in your environment. The problem occurs when creating new SharePoint sites. Once the site has been created, it will most likely share the same ID with a couple of other homepages.

- [Getting up to speed with Yeoman aka “yo” · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/getting-up-to-speed-with-yeoman-aka-yo/): Yeoman is yet another tool that you cannot miss in your client-side development toolset. In the previous post, I talked about Node.js, npm and Gulp. To make use of these tools it required some manual actions/configuration before you could start developing your project.

In this session, I highlighted a couple of simple things that mostly stay untouched and things that can be quickly implemented.
One of these key takeaways was implementing synonyms. Configuring synonyms can be done via the thesaurus functionality and works on-premises differently than on SharePoint Online.

## A-new-way-of-developing-display-templates

- [A new way of developing display templates · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/a-new-way-of-developing-display-templates/): Creating display templates for SharePoint is a fairly easy job, but we all have our own ways of developing them. Over the last couple of months, I barely touched managed code. Everything I do these days is mainly achieved by using JavaScript and/or TypeScript in combination with Visual Studio Code. As I really like this new way of working, I started testing how this could ease my display template development process and it turned out to be very useful.

- [Do something after all refiners templates have completed rendering · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/do-something-after-all-refiners-templates-are-rendered/): If you created your own display templates, you most probably have used the AddPostRenderCallback function. The AddPostRenderCallback function allows you to execute code once the display template completed rendering and this function can be used in every template (control, item, …).
Now when you are creating your own refiner display templates and want to do something once all the refiners are rendered, the first approach would be to create a AddPostRenderCallback function in the refinement control template.

I used this method for synchronizing an external planning system to Office 365. This enabled our users to go to a MVC site and manually start the synchronization process. The next thing on my to-do list was to create a daemon or service application which performs a synchronization on a scheduled basis via an Azure WebJob.

- [Hiding the content by search web part (title) when there are no results · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/hiding-the-cswp-title-when-there-are-no-results/): If you are using content by search web part (CSWP), it might sometimes happen that no results are retrieved for a particular query.

- [People refinement made easy by adding profile pictures · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/people-refinement-made-easy-by-adding-profile-pictures/): In various SharePoint environments I see that clients mostly use the predefined refiners that you get from an out of the box search center. These refiners could of course help your users to find the right results, but they can always be made better.
The author refiner for example can simply be more useful by adding the user his or her profile picture next to their name.

- [Display publishing image with a link correctly within a display template · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/display-publishing-image-with-a-link-correctly-within-a-display-template/): When you create a display template that displays a publishing image (example: the roll-up image of a page) it might be that you used the Srch.ContentBySearch.getPictureMarkup() function of SharePoint. This function is also used in the standard display templates like for example: Item_Picture3Lines.html.
This Srch.ContentBySearch.getPictureMarkup provides you the markup for rendering the image with the image rendition of your choice.

The in-place searchbox allows you to quickly search for items or documents while staying in the list or library context (in previous versions you were redirected to a search page).

When using the auto-created managed properties linked to your managed metadata column for sorting, a disorder of your results can occur.

## Filtering-results-predefined-set-values-display-template

- [Filtering results on predefined set of values in your display template · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/filtering-results-predefined-set-values-display-template/): For one of my clients I investigated the possibility to include result filtering or refinement into a display template for the Content Search Web Part. The reason to include this filtering functionality into a display template is to make it easier to fit into the corporate design. Another reason is to minimum the amount of display templates that get loaded on your page.

- [Adding a link to the search result list or library into your display template · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/adding-link-search-result-list-library-display-template/): A lot of users want to get an overview of the latest items of a list or library. Some users want to include a link to the list or library from which the items were retrieved.

## Adding-customizing-actions-search-hover-panel

- [Adding and customizing actions in the search hover panel · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/adding-customizing-actions-search-hover-panel/): Adding custom actions to a search hover panel is completely different than when you are doing it for an item/document callout. When adding a custom action to item or document callout you will be able to override the default footer with your own custom actions. These things can be done without touching any of the existing JavaScript files (add a custom action - add a custom action for a specific file type).

- [Find out in which Office rich client your Office APP is opened · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/find-office-rich-client-office-app-opened/): Some time ago I posted an article about how you can check in which context your mail APP has been opened in OWA or the Outlook rich client (read the post here). I needed that solution for a proof of concept mail app.
The mail app is finished, so I wanted to go a step further and I also made the APP work in the other Office applications.

- [Changing the number of visible list views in the view selector of a list or library · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/changing-number-visible-list-views-view-selector-list-library-2/): For a colleague I did some checks on how the view selector rendering is achieved in lists and libraries. While digging through the code I found a very useful property, which is the ClientPivotControl.prototype.SurfacedPivotCount property.

## Office-graph-search-queries-sharepoint-search-center

- [Office graph search queries from within your SharePoint search center · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/office-graph-search-queries-sharepoint-search-center/): Now that Delve is out, it is time to do some experiments with it.

- [How to use Google Fonts in your font scheme · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/use-google-fonts-font-scheme/): In the previous post I showed you how to create a font scheme with custom web fonts.

Which was quite challenging, because you do not have all the features available which you have in a normal publishing site.
A couple of thing have been changed:

## Add-attachment-mail-via-owa-app

- [How to add an attachment to a mail via an OWA App · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/add-attachment-mail-via-owa-app/): For one of our company events later this month, I developed a demo OWA app which could add attachments to a mail. I used the following MSDN article to achieve this: Add and remove attachments to an item in a compose form in Outlook. In the article they give a good overview, but there is one little problem with the example code.

- [$setResultItem a function that makes or breaks your search experience · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/setresultitem-function-makes-breaks-search-experience/): A couple of days ago I was talking with Mikael Svenson, he asked me what the $setResultItem function does. Because there is no information to be found on the internet, I wanted to share this information with everyone. This function can completly change the behaviour of your search center, so it is important to know what it does in your display templates.

## Get-javascript-intellisense-syntax-highlighting-html-display-templates

- [How to get JavaScript intellisense and syntax highlighting in HTML display templates · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/get-javascript-intellisense-syntax-highlighting-html-display-templates/): It is very easy to create your own HTML display templates in SharePoint 2013, but one thing you probably miss the most, is intellisense and syntax highlighting for your JavaScript code.

Another thing I was thinking of is if it is possible to move all the code from the item template to the control template, so that the item display template can be ignored.

- [Table layout display template with managed property sorting · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/table-layout-display-template-with-managed-property-sorting/): In my last two blog posts I talked about how you could add sorting, and how to find out if a managed property is sortable. These two posts were created during the creating time of a table layout display template. Of course there are a couple of table layout templates already, but none had the option to sort the results.

## Know-managed-property-sortable-with-javascript

- [How to know if a managed property is sortable with JavaScript · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/know-managed-property-sortable-with-javascript/): In my previous post I talked about how you could add managed property sorting in a display templates.

## Add-sorting-display-templates

- [How to add sorting in display templates · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/add-sorting-display-templates/): An idea where I’m currently working on involves sorting of the search results in display templates. So I thought it would be interesting to share this information already. You will see that enabling sorting, won’t involve a lot of code. You just need to know what you need to do, before you can start sorting the results.

- [Grouping search results with display templates for the CSWP · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/grouping-search-results-with-display-templates-for-the-cswp/): This post was something that has been on my to-do list for quite some time, and was also requested by a couple of people. So finally I found the time to work this out.
Back in SharePoint 2010 and 2007 we could easily group the results in the Content Query Web Part, but this functionality isn’t included in the Content Search Web Part.

- [Document set view not visible in SharePoint 2013 · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/document-set-view-not-visible-in-sharepoint-2013/): Some time ago I wrote a post about the missing Apps you can add zone (Missing the Apps you can add Zone When Adding a New App).

- [Define custom server side rendering for catalog items with XSLT · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/define-custom-server-side-rendering-catalog-items-xslt/): XSLT and SharePoint 2013, didn’t thought I was going to use it now that we have display templates.

In this post I’ll cover the topic on how you could format the values on the client side.
The reason I created this post, is because there isn’t much information available around this topic.

Last week on the HTML5 Web Camp session in Belgium, she talked about the site pinning functionality of IE9. She also recommended a jQuery plugin called ie9ify that makes site pinning integration much easier.

- [Problem With List Views That Exceeds Browser Window Width · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/problem-with-list-views-that-exceeds-browser-window-width/): Last week a customer indicated that layout problems could arise with list views.

Wouldn’t that be cool? This was the idea that a colleague and I had last week.

The Google Visualization API is very handy if you want to visualize your data.

## Minimal-master-with-footer

- [Minimal.master with footer · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/minimal-master-with-footer/): This blog post is created by a request of a commenter named Gane.

- [SharePoint: Create permissions on list views · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/sharepoint-2007-create-permissions-on-list-views/): First of all I’ve tried the same approach for SharePoint 2010 and this works the same way.
One of the things I miss the most in SharePoint 2007 is to set permissions on list views. I thought it was impossible to achieve this with the out-of-the-box functionality of SharePoint. After some research I found a way to achieve all this. My goal was to do it without writing or modifying any code in SharePoint. The solution consists of a number of manual steps, that I will describe in detail below, to accomplish this.

- [V4.master Sticky Footer With Docked Ribbon · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/v4-master-with-sticky-footer-and-docked-ribbon/): After getting the footer working in the undocked version, I have tried to get it to work with a docked ribbon.
The problem is that SharePoint’s Javascript will automatically calculate the exact size of the div “s4-workspace” each time you click on the ribbon or a webpart. This will push the footer off the screen or the bottom from the scrollbar falls of the screen.

- [V4.master Sticky Footer With Undocked Ribbon · Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/v4-master-sticky-footer-with-undocked-ribbon/): Hi,
This is actually my first blog post and it’s about my first real frustration and moment of joy with SharePoint 2010.
This week I wanted to insert a “sticky” footer to my masterpage (v4.master). For two days I have tried to get it working on Internet Explorer and Firefox, but for some reasons it always came out as a disappointment.
