Over the last couple of months, I have been working at a great company. When the time comes, I'll be able to tell you more about it. Some of you might know where I moved. For the ones that don't, I can say it wasn't a Microsoft focussed company.

I have been interested in seeing how other companies and technology stacks are progressing. That is why I moved from Valo to company X, which allowed me to learn and explore other technology stacks and integrate closely with Microsoft technologies.

At the beginning of this journey, I explored the possibilities of using the Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Graph to build a combined integration. When the R&D work was completed, and the team and I were finally ready to start building the product integration, I had my accident.

## Keeping my mind busy

From June 2021 until September 2021, I was not allowed to work at all. To keep my mind busy with something, I decided to take [Front Matter](https://frontmatter.codes) to the next level. 

Back in 2019, I created the extension to make it easier for others and myself to manage my static site (generated by Hugo). Initially, its primary focus was to handle the front matter of your Markdown articles. Later on, came the ability to extend it with your scripts.

When I could not work, I started thinking about letting Front Matter become a full-fledged Content Management System (CMS) and started working slowly on it.

The work that went into it was spotted by [Ahmad Awais](https://twitter.com/MrAhmadAwais). Over Twitter, he asked me if we could chat about the extension, see what it can do, and hear the background story. It was a fun and exciting discussion, but before I knew it, we were suddenly chatting about an opportunity to work for [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com), and so my interview process started.

The interview process went great (otherwise, I wouldn't be writing this post). It included an assessment, a technical interview, and a couple of chats with key people at the company. I was able to get a good understanding of the company and its product offerings.

I believe that APIs are mandatory and essential for the future. More and more, we hear about the upcoming low-code and no-code platforms and projects involving code, and APIs make it all possible. APIs create synergy, allow low-code applications to visualize data, make development projects succeed, and so much more.

## The job offer

After all interviews, they offered me a role to become a Lead DevTools Engineer at [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com). The offer was something I couldn't refuse. It is a unique opportunity and feels like it was just made for me.

Working for a company with a great vision and using the technologies I like, made the jump so much easier. If such an opportunity comes on your path, jump. 

> **Info**: This made me think back to my words from my 2019 recap: Don’t be afraid if you don’t know your goals in life. Some day you’ll wake up and have a fantastic idea or opportunity, and that’s the moment you’ll have to jump!
