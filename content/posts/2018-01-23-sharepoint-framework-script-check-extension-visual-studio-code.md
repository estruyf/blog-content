I published another extension for your SharePoint Framework solution to check your scripts and correctly reference the external JavaScript libraries in your solutions.

The extension is powered by the same APIs of the [SharePoint Framework Script Check](https://rencore.com/sharepoint-framework/script-check/) that was built by [Waldek Mastykarz](https://twitter.com/waldekm) from [Rencore](https://rencore.com/).

> Check out the VSCode extension: [SPFx Script Check](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.spfx-script-check)
