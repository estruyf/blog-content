For the [Front Matter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.vscode-front-matter) Visual Studio Code extension, I needed to know if the current instance opened a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) located project folder. 

By knowing this context, I could ensure that certain functionality works similarly to the default behavior on Windows and macOS.

## The solution

The solution is a very simple one-liner:

{{< highlight typescript "linenos=table,noclasses=false" >}}
const isWsl = vscode.env.remoteName === "wsl";
{{< / highlight >}}

## How I use it

I have two buttons in the Front Matter extension to open the project- and file folder in finder/explorer. When running in WSL, the `revealFileInOS` command from VSCode is not available. You need to use the `remote-wsl.revealInExplorer` command instead. With the one-liner, I can now do the following:

{{< highlight typescript "linenos=table,noclasses=false" >}}
const isWsl = vscode.env.remoteName === "wsl";
if (isWsl) {
  commands.executeCommand('remote-wsl.revealInExplorer');
} else {
  commands.executeCommand('revealFileInOS');
}
{{< / highlight >}}
