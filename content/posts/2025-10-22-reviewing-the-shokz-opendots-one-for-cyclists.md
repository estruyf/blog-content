Since 2019, I have been a big fan of **Shokz** (previously AfterShokz) headphones. Their open-ear and bone-conduction designs have made sense for cyclists who want to enjoy music or podcasts while staying aware of their surroundings.

After my **OpenRun Pro 2** became my go-to companion for long solo rides, Shokz sent me the **OpenDots One** to try out. I have now completed several rides with them, and here are my thoughts.

{{< blockquote type="note" text="This review is not sponsored. Shokz provided the OpenDots One for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own." >}}

## First impressions

The Shokz OpenDots One are completely different. They are smaller, lighter, and use a clip-on open-ear design instead of the wrap-around style of the OpenRun Pro 2. This design makes them more convenient to wear, although they might look a bit unusual at first.

One of the biggest advantages I noticed is that you can **use just one earbud**. This is incredibly handy for group rides because it allows you to keep one ear completely free to talk to the rider next to you while still having audio in the other ear. It gives you a good balance between awareness and entertainment.

## Sound quality

The **sound quality** of the OpenDots One really surprised me. Compared to the OpenRun Pro 2, the audio is richer and more immersive, especially for **podcasts or spoken audio**. They deliver a clear, balanced tone with a nice bass presence for such a lightweight device.

Even at higher speeds, the sound remains crisp and enjoyable. However, the **main downside** becomes noticeable on windy days. When the wind picks up, you will hardly hear anything. The open design lets in all ambient noise, which is great for safety but makes it hard to follow a podcast when facing strong gusts. I faced similar issues with the OpenRun Pro 2, although this is where bone conduction has the benefit of slightly better wind handling.

## Comfort and fit

The OpenDots One are comfortable and feel secure on the ears. They do not interfere with glasses or helmet straps, which is always a plus. During long rides, I barely noticed them. I would say they are even more comfortable than the OpenRun Pro 2, which can feel weird depending on the glasses you wear.

Compared to the OpenRun Pro 2, the OpenDots offer a bit more flexibility in how you wear them, thanks to the single-ear option. However, the **controls** are not as intuitive. Adjusting volume or skipping tracks is easier on the OpenRun Pro 2, which has more tactile buttons that are accessible even with gloves on.

## Battery life

Battery performance is great. I've used them on three rides of 3 hours each, and they still had battery left afterward. Each bud can last up to around 11 hours (at least that is what the specs say), and the case provides roughly 40 hours of total charge. On multi-day rides, this means you can go for several outings without needing to recharge.

## Safety and awareness

Like all Shokz models, the OpenDots One keep your ears open to the environment. You can still hear cars, cyclists, or conversations around you. This is what makes open-ear headphones ideal for road cycling.

Although the sound is more directed into your ear canal compared to bone conduction, you still get a good level of situational awareness if you lower the volume.

When used with one bud, this awareness increases even more, and you can chat naturally with others while riding. The trade-off is that you lose some sound immersion, especially in noisy or windy conditions.

## Riding on colder days

Another benefit of the OpenDots One compared to the OpenRun Pro 2 is that I can use them comfortably on colder days. Since they don’t wrap around the back of the head, I can wear a beanie or headband over my ears without interference. This is a big plus for autumn and winter rides when temperatures drop.

## Comparing OpenDots One and OpenRun Pro 2

Here is a quick summary of how both models perform based on my experience.

| Feature | Shokz OpenDots One | Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 |
|----------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Design** | Clip-on open-ear earbuds | Wrap-around bone conduction |
| **Sound** | Rich and balanced, great for podcasts | Slightly less bass but very clear |
| **Wind performance** | Struggles in strong wind | Handles wind a bit better |
| **Controls** | Smaller, less tactile | Easier to use during rides and when wearing gloves |
| **Single ear use** | Yes | No |
| **Battery life** | Up to 11 hours per charge | Around 12 hours per charge |
| **Comfort** | Very light | Slightly bulkier but stable |
| **Ideal for** | Group rides, podcasts | Long solo rides, windy conditions |

Both headphones are great options, but they serve slightly different purposes. If you want maximum awareness and control, the **OpenRun Pro 2** still wins. If you prefer flexibility and comfort, the **OpenDots One** are a strong alternative.

## Conclusion

After several rides, the **Shokz OpenDots One** have earned a permanent spot in my cycling gear. The ability to ride with one earbud, the improved sound quality for podcasts, and their lightweight comfort make them an excellent choice.  

The **downside** remains the wind, you won’t hear much when it’s strong and the **controls** could be more practical for on-the-go use. But overall, the OpenDots One provide a new level of convenience and are perfect for riders who value both safety and simplicity.

If you are a cyclist looking for open-ear audio that keeps you connected to your surroundings, the **Shokz OpenDots One** are definitely worth trying.

Happy riding, and stay safe!
