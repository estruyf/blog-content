Yesterday I received **the** email from Microsoft.

I am very happy and honored to have received this MVP award from Microsoft. My main community contributions the past years were of course my blog and the several speaking opportunities. I want to thank all the people who have given me these opportunities and the people that supported me. Special thanks to my employer [Ventigrate](http://www.ventigrate.be "Ventigrate"), to Microsoft and last but not least [BIWUG](http://www.biwug.be "BIWUG") community.
