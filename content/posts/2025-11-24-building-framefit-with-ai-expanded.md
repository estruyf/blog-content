I have a problem that many technical writers and product managers will recognize: inconsistent screenshots. When you're creating documentation, having windows at different sizes makes everything look unprofessional. One image shows a browser at 1200px wide, the next at 1400px, and suddenly your work looks messy. I needed a tool to fix this.

I found [Burke Holland's ResizeMe](https://burkeholland.github.io/ResizeMe/), which was close, but I wanted something more tailored to my specific workflow. So, I decided to build my own solution: [**FrameFit**](https://github.com/estruyf/FrameFit). The challenge I set for myself was to build a fully functional macOS app in just three hours. With the help of AI, I did it.

This is the story of that three-hour journey, the good, the bad, and the surprising ways AI is changing how we build software.

### The First Step: Defining the Vision with AI

I started my journey with [CommandCode.ai](https://commandcode.ai), an AI development tool I was beta testing. My first step wasn't writing code, but writing a clear prompt. I asked `cmd` to build the app with a simple set of requirements:

> "Create me a macOS app that will be used to resize application windows to a preset of sizes and also allow to set custom presets. The application is inspired by the https://github.com/burkeholland/ResizeMe project."

I also specified my preferred tech stack—what the tool calls "tastes"—including [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), and that all app references should be named "[**FrameFit**](https://github.com/estruyf/FrameFit)". I decided on [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) for the underlying framework, which allows you to build desktop applications with web technologies.

### The First Roadblock: When the AI Stumbles

The AI completed the job, but the initial output wasn't perfect. I was met with a couple of build errors. This is where the real collaboration began.

The first error was a fundamental one: nothing from Tauri seemed to be working correctly. It was a frustrating start. After some investigation, I realized the AI-generated setup was flawed. I solved it by creating a default "Hello World" Tauri app myself and feeding that clean structure back to the AI. It learned from this, and we were past the first hurdle.

Next, a more subtle issue appeared with the [`tauri-plugin-store`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/v1/plugins/store), a plugin for persistent data storage. The configuration generated by the AI was for an older version of the plugin, creating a version mismatch that broke the build.

This back-and-forth process was crucial. The AI wasn't a magic wand; it was a "copilot" (haha, that is why GitHub/Microsoft named it "Copilot") that needed guidance and correction.

### The Debugging Dance: A Tale of Two Errors

With the initial setup fixed, I moved on to the UI. The AI-generated UI was visually "perfect," with a nice grid for presets and inputs for custom dimensions, all styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). But the functionality was broken. This led to two interesting debugging stories.

#### 1. The Hardcoded Screen Resolution

I asked the AI to implement a feature to center the app window on the screen. Visually, it failed spectacularly, placing the window at the top-right or bottom-right of my screen. I did a quick code review and immediately spotted the problem: the AI had hardcoded the screen resolution to `1920x1080`. My screen was much larger, so the coordinates were completely off.

I didn't need to fix this myself. I simply pointed out the issue to the AI and asked it to use the *current* screen's resolution instead of a hardcoded value. It understood and corrected the logic.

#### 2. The Cryptic AppleScript Failure

The core of the app relies on [AppleScript](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/introduction/ASLR_intro.html) to control and resize application windows. The AI's first attempt failed with a cryptic error:

```
AppleScript error: 402:406: execution error: System Events got an error: Can’t get desktop 1 of application process "Ghostty". (-1728)
```

I fed this error back to the AI. It provided a fix, which then led to a *new* error:

```
AppleScript error: 127:131: execution error: System Events got an error: Can’t get size of desktop 1. (-1728)
```

The AI fixed that one too, but then the positioning was incorrect. At this point, I recognized the pattern. Just like with the UI centering issue, the AppleScript was likely using hardcoded screen dimensions. I prompted the AI to use the dynamic screen resolution, and after providing the correct file paths for the script to modify, everything finally clicked into place.

### The 3-Hour Verdict: AI as an Accelerator

In just under three hours, [**FrameFit**](https://github.com/estruyf/FrameFit) was a living, breathing, and, most importantly, functional macOS app. The journey wasn't seamless, but the AI's involvement was transformative. It handled the boilerplate, generated complex logic, and, even when it made mistakes, it provided a solid foundation that we could debug and refine together.

This experience taught me that AI doesn't replace the developer. It empowers them. My ability to spot a hardcoded value or understand the context of a cryptic error message was essential. The AI wrote the code, but I provided the direction, the oversight, and the critical thinking to guide us to the finish line.
