The month May will be a busy this year with a couple of speaking engagements. A few of weeks ago I fantastic news that I was selected as a speaker for **SPC Adriatics** ([http://www.spcadriatics.com/](http://www.spcadriatics.com/)). This conference will be held from May 31 to June 1. Early bird registration is still open till 31 March, so if you want, you can reserve your spot here: [registration](http://www.spcadriatics.com/attendee-registration/).

But SPC Adriatics is not the only event in May, I will also be speaking at two great SharePoint Saturday events in Stockholm on May 21 ([event info](http://www.spsevents.org/city/stockholm/stockholm2016)) and in Paris on May 28 ([event info](http://www.spsevents.org/city/paris/paris2016)).

## Sessions

### SPS Stockholm (May 21)

I am very honoured that I speak again for the second time in Stockholm. SPS Stockholm two years ago was my first foreign speaking experience. At this event, I will be speaking together with fellow MVP Thomas Vochten about Search.

> **An IT Pro and a developer walk into a bar - SharePoint Search happy hour** (IT Pro & Dev - lvl 200)
> 
> Out of the box, SharePoint Search is pretty good. But do you know what it takes to bring your users' search experience to the next level? This session will present you with an all-you-can-eat menu of smaller and bigger tweaks to your search engine. From setting up and scaling the infrastructure needed - with a bit of hybrid sprinkled on top - to mixing the right cocktail of user interface tweaks and optimizations to get your users actually *using* search. Developers and administrators unite to create a better search engine!

### SPS Paris (May 28)

This year the second SharePoint Saturday Paris is organized in May again, and I am very happy to be part of it again. Last year I talked about how you can improve your search experience. This year I will be talking about display templates.

> **Search display templates tips and tricks** (Dev - lvl 300)
> 
> Everyone has its own ways on creating display templates for SharePoint. Some of you just modify existing one's; others are creating magnificent templates from scratch. During this session I give away my personal tips and tricks about creating these search display templates. You will learn to write your code in a better way, which useful functions you could use, how to debug these templates, etc.

### SPC Adriatics (May 31 to June 1)

The last event for me in May is SPC Adriatics. Also, at this event I will be talking about display templates.

> Everyone has its own ways on creating display templates for SharePoint. Some of you just modify existing one's; others create magnificent templates from scratch. During this session I show you how to take your display template skill to the next level. In this session I will show you how you can create display templates easier by writing your code with a different approach. You will also learn a couple of useful function that can be leveraged for automatically refreshing results or loading even more results. The session is built upon a set of demo's that vary from grouping results to creating a navigation control with display templates.
