By default search suggestions are enabled on the default search boxes in SharePoint 2013.

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2013/01/011613_1828_AddingCusto1.png" "Search Suggestions"  "data:image/jpeg;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAGCAIAAAB1kpiRAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAfUlEQVR4nF3LWwrCMBCF4ex/Xe5BEBUVa25NZtK5tCltFJFC8ed7OxwDMtlEw7igzMD1B2UOwAHI2D4fTxcfMxSisfJmELWpmFzEOosAdaqttfcuZDW55Nv9EWIU0XVd29Z3JjW9P5yvnXMvJv57A6kBfHYeQ8JcGEn3gOQDEpOrHIM5OZUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" "256" "165" >}}

Server administrators are still able to manually add search suggestions via PowerShell, but the commands have been changed a little.

Check out the following [blog post](http://blogs.technet.com/b/chad/archive/2010/06/24/tip-34-adding-a-sharepoint-2010-search-suggestion.aspx "Adding a SharePoint 2010 Search Suggestion") how to do it in SharePoint 2010.

The command that has been changed is the `New-SPEnterpriseSearchLanguageResourcePhrase`. This cmdlet now has a new required parameter named **Owner**.

Technet information about Owner: "Specifies the search object owner that defines the scope at which the corresponding **LanguageResourcePhrase** is created".

This Owner parameter is also used in the `Get-SPEnterpriseSearchLanguageResourcePhrase`.

The Available levels that can be used are:

*   Search Service Application: SSA;
*   Site Subscription: SPSiteSubscription;
*   Site Collection: SPSite;
*   Site: SPWeb.

You need to run the following commands to create search suggestions:

```powershell
$searchapp = get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication
$owner = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchOwner -level SSA

New-SPEnterpriseSearchLanguageResourcePhrase -SearchApplication $searchapp -Language En-Us -Type QuerySuggestionAlwaysSuggest -Name "Suggestion 1" -Owner $owner

Start-SPTimerJob -Identity "Prepare query suggestions"
```
