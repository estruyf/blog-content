I am pleased to tell you that I will be speaking at SharePoint Saturday Paris on May, 30th. This event is organised by [Benoit Jester](https://twitter.com/SPAsipe), [Patrick Guimonet](https://twitter.com/patricg), and [Gokan Ozcifci](https://twitter.com/GokanOzcifci). These guys already did an amazing job with their personalized speaker announcements and the agenda they put together.

## <span id="DeltaPlaceHolderPageTitleInTitleArea">Implementing a better search experience</span>

Most companies that are using SharePoint do not invest any time and money in their Enterprise Search. Users get frustrated when they do not find their documents, or do not have a clue how to find them. This session shows the technical possibilities how you could implement a better search experience for your users. The content is built upon the context of a novice and expert users. These two types of users need to be approached differently. Where novice users needs guidance when searching for their documents, expert users needs to have triggers to discover new content.
