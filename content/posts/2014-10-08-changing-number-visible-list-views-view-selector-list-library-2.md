For a colleague I did some checks on how the view selector rendering is achieved in lists and libraries. While digging through the code I found a very useful property, which is the **ClientPivotControl.prototype.SurfacedPivotCount** property. This property is used to define the amount of list views that are visible on the list view selector.

The default property value is **3**, which you can also check in all your lists and libraries. You always receive three view links, the other views can be accessed underneath in the list view menu (...):

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2014/10/100714_2010_Changingthe11.png" "Default list view selector" >}}

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2014/10/100714_2010_Changingthe21.png" "List view selector menu" >}}

Now by changing this property, for example to **6** in my example, all my list views become available:

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2014/10/100714_2010_Changingthe31.png" "List view selector with 6 available views" >}}

The code to achieve this fairly simple:

```javascript
// With MDS enabled
ExecuteOrDelayUntilScriptLoaded(function () {
  if (typeof ClientPivotControl.prototype.SurfacedPivotCount !== "undefined") {
    ClientPivotControl.prototype.SurfacedPivotCount = 6;
  }
}, "start.js");

// Without MDS
if (typeof ClientPivotControl.prototype.SurfacedPivotCount !== "undefined") {
  ClientPivotControl.prototype.SurfacedPivotCount = 6;
}
```
