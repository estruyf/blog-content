My intention was to write three blog posts on this topic, but a commenter told me that a problem arises with blog post items. The counters always return zero.

In this part I will show you why this is happening and what you could do to solve this.

First of all the reason why it is happening.

## Reason

A standard blog post URL in SharePoint looks like this: http://sp2010/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=1.

Using this URL on the **Manage Social Tags and Notes** page of my user profile service, it did not return any results.

Normally it should return the following items:

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2012/04/040812_1804_TakeyourSha3.png" "Blog post tags" >}}

When I did a query for all the tags from a specific user, I noticed something interesting:

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2012/04/040812_1804_TakeyourSha4.png" "ViewPost Reference" >}}

The tags are not linked to the Post.aspx page, but to the **ViewPost.aspx** page: http://sp2010/Lists/Posts/ViewPost.aspx?ID=1.

When I checked the URL of the Social Data Frame, I saw that it also used the **ViewPost.aspx** page as reference.

## Solution

The solution is very simple, you only need to replace the Post.aspx from the URL path with ViewPost.aspx.

Here is the code to do this:

```csharp
// Get page URL
Uri uri = this.Page.Request.Url;
// Check if it is a blog post
if (-1 == uri.AbsoluteUri.IndexOf("post.aspx", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
{
  // Check if page is welcome page
  string root = web.RootFolder.WelcomePage;
  // Check if welcome page is not empty
  if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(root))
  {
    if (uri.AbsoluteUri.Contains(root))
    {
      uri = new Uri(SPContext.Current.Web.Url);
    }
  }
}
else
{
  uri = new Uri(uri.AbsoluteUri.Replace("Post.aspx", "ViewPost.aspx"));
}
```

Here you can find the whole code:
