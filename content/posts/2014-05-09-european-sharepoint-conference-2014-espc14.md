The ESPC this year was a blast, there were a couple of very good sessions, but the main reason was to meet some people in real life. There were a couple of very good after parties, like the AvePoint Red Part and the BIWUG SharePint we organised on Wednesday evening.

During the ESPC14 I tried to take some pictures on each day, check them down here.
