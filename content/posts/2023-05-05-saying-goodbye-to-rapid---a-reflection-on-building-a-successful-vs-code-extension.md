It's with a heavy heart that I need to say farewell to Rapid. In this company, I had the opportunity to work and build a Visual Studio Code extension that quickly gained popularity among developers. Today Rapid decided to lay off even more people. This time, I was one of them.

> More information about it: [RapidAPI, valued at $1 billion last year, cuts staff by 50%](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/rapidapi-valued-at-1-billion-last-year-cuts-staff-by-50/).

My time at Rapid was a memorable and fulfilling experience, and I want to share my reflections on this journey.

Firstly, let me tell you that working at Rapid was a great experience. The team was full of talented and passionate developers who were always striving to create products that made a difference. Their energy and enthusiasm were contagious, and it motivated me to give my best.

One of the highlights of my time at Rapid was building a Visual Studio Code extension. As a developer, it's always rewarding to see your work being appreciated and adopted by users. The fact that our product gained so much traction among developers was a testament to the team's dedication and hard work. Since the launch in July 2021, the extension has been installed over 190k times and had over 100k monthly active users.

Today I was told I am one of the people being laid off. I am sad to leave Rapid, but I am also excited about what the future holds. To all the wonderful people I met during my time at Rapid, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude. It was an absolute pleasure to work with you all, and I learned so much from each and every one of you. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors and hope that our paths will cross again someday.

Of course, it's possible that we may not cross paths again. Life has a way of taking us in unexpected directions. But no matter where our journeys take us, I want to leave you with this simple reminder: keep smiling.

Life can be tough, and it's easy to get bogged down by the challenges we face. But a smile can go a long way in brightening up someone's day - even if that someone is yourself. So, no matter what happens, keep smiling and spreading positivity wherever you go.

Looking back, I'm grateful for the opportunities I had and the wonderful people I met during my time at Rapid. Building a successful Visual Studio Code extension was a rewarding experience, and I'm proud to have been a part of it. As I embark on a new chapter in my career, I'll always cherish the memories and lessons learned during my time at Rapid.
