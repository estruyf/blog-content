Today I published a new Visual Studio Code extension that gives you some handy SharePoint Framework code snippets. The first version of the extension only contains a handful snippets but will grow over time.

> VSCode extension: [SPFx snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.spfx-snippets)

Try it out and let me know if you like it.

## Feedback and ideas

If you have feedback or ideas of snippets that you want to see included in this extension, feel free to send in an issue on my GitHub repository: [issue list](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-spfx-snippets/issues).

## Other VSCode extensions

Did you know there were two other extensions for SPFx and VSCode?

*   [SPFx Essentials](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.spfx-essentials): essential extensions for SharePoint Framework projects / developers.
*   [SPFx Debug Configuration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.spfx-debug): Debug configuration extension for SharePoint Framework projects / developers.
