A colleague discovered a layout problem when he was using the **People Search Box Web Part** outside a SharePoint Search Center.

When you add the **People Search Box Web Part** to your page, the layout looks fine.

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2011/07/070811_1434_FixPeopleSe1.png" "People Search Box" >}}

The problem arises when you click on the **Search Options** link.

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2011/07/070811_1434_FixPeopleSe2.png" "People Search Box Layout Problem" >}}

As you can see, the property box is shown with a transparent background and the labels are almost unreadable.

## Solution

To solve this problem, you could add the following CSS styles to your custom stylesheet or inside the master page itself.


```css
.psrch-OptionsContainer {
  font-size: 8pt;
  height: 130px;
  margin-top: 20px;
  width: 355px;
}
```


## Result
