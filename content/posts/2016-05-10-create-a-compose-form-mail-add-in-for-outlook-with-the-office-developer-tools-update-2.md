A couple of weeks ago the Office Developer Tools received its second update. These tools include the latest Office add-in project template that help you create add-ins for Excel, Word, Outlook, ...

> **Info**: The Office developer tools for Visual Studio can be found here - [https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/office-tools-vs.aspx](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/office-tools-vs.aspx)

With the help of these tools, you should get up and running with Office Add-in development in no time. In fact, it was quicker in the previous version. There are a couple of things that got changed in this update. First of all, when you are going to create a new project, you will be asked which type of add-in you are going to create:

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2016/05/051016_1432_Createacomp1.png" "New Office developer templates" >}}

Before this update it looked as follows:

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2016/05/051016_1432_Createacomp2.png" "Previous version of the Office templates" >}}

This is a good change, but let's say if you want to create an Outlook add-in. Before you had the option to specify which type of add-in you wanted to create:

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2016/05/051016_1432_Createacomp3.png" "Mail add-in options" >}}

This wizard is not there anymore. The moment you create the project from the new Outlook Add-in template. It will automatically create a project with a read form add-in. You do not get the option to choose which type of add-in(s) you want to create. In my opinion, this makes things a bit tougher when you were used to what the previous version provided.

So in case, if you want to create a compose form add-in, you have to do some manual configuration to make it work.

## Setting up the required files for your compose form add-in

Start by creating a new **ComposeForm **folder in your project for the compose form. This is not required, but it is cleaner to separate the forms.

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2016/05/051016_1432_Createacomp4.png" "ComposeForm folder" >}}

Add the following files to the **ComposeForm** folder:

*   Form.html
*   Form.css
*   Form.js

**Form.html**

Add the following code to your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge" />
    <title></title>
    <script src="Scripts/jquery-1.9.1.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

    <!-- For the JavaScript APIs for Office, go to http://aka.ms/officejs-overview to learn more. -->
    <script src="https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/1/hosted/office.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

    <!-- To enable offline debugging using a local reference to Office.js, use: -->
    <!-- <script src="Scripts/Office/MicrosoftAjax.js" type="text/javascript"></script>  -->
    <!-- <script src="Scripts/Office/1/office.js" type="text/javascript"></script>  -->

    <script src="Form.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

    <!-- For the Office UI Fabric, go to http://aka.ms/office-ui-fabric to learn more. -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/fabric/2.1.0/fabric.min.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/fabric/2.1.0/fabric.components.min.css" />

    <!-- To enable the offline use of Office UI Fabric, use: -->
    <!-- link rel="stylesheet" href="Content/fabric.min.css" -->
    <!-- link rel="stylesheet" href="Content/fabric.components.min.css" -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="Form.css" />
</head>
<body class="ms-font-m">
    <h1>Your compose form</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

**Form.js**

Add the following code to your JS file:

```html
(function () {
    "use strict";

    // The Office initialize function must be run each time a new page is loaded.
    Office.initialize = function (reason) {
        $(document).ready(function () {
            // Write some code
        });
    };
})();
```


## Configuring the compose form

Now that all the required files are in place, it is time to configure the compose form to the manifest XML file.

*   Open the manifest file;
{{< caption-new "/uploads/2016/05/051016_1432_Createacomp5.png" "Open the Office add-in manifest" >}}

*   Find the **FormSettings** element;
{{< caption-new "/uploads/2016/05/051016_1432_Createacomp6.png" "ItemRead form" >}}

*   Insert the compose form element underneath the read form;

```html
<Form xsi:type="ItemEdit">
  <DesktopSettings>
    <SourceLocation DefaultValue="~remoteAppUrl/ComposeForm/Form.html"/>
  </DesktopSettings>
</Form>
```

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2016/05/051016_1432_Createacomp7.png" "Read and Edit form configuration" >}}

> **Info**: If you do not want to show the read form. You can remove the **ItemRead** form from the **FormSettings** element.

*   Next is to add a new rule element. Find the **Rule** element in the file;

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2016/05/051016_1432_Createacomp8.png" "Read rule" >}}

*   Add a new **Rule** element for the Edit form type;

```xml
<Rule xsi:type="ItemIs" ItemType="Message" FormType="ReadOrEdit" />
```

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2016/05/051016_1432_Createacomp9.png" "ReadOrEdit form type" >}}

> **Info**: If you do not want to show the read form. You can change the **FormType** to **Edit** instead.

At this point, you configured the compose form for Outlook Online and Outlook 2013. If you want to use the add-in in Outlook 2016 you will have to do a bit more configuration in order to get it working.

### Outlook 2016 configuration - add-in commands

For Outlook 2016 you will have to configure an additional add-in command in order to load the task pane. The configuration for this need to be done in the same manifest file as where you did the previous changes.

Find the **ExtensionPoint** element in the manifest file. This is the add-in command which is defined for the read form.

{{< caption-new "/uploads/2016/05/051016_1432_Createacomp10.png" "Outlook 2016 - read add-in command" >}}

Add a new **ExtensionPoint** element for your compose form with the following code:

```xml
<!-- Message Compose -->
<ExtensionPoint xsi:type="MessageComposeCommandSurface">
	<OfficeTab id="TabDefault">
		<Group id="msgComposeGroup">
			<Label resid="groupLabel" />
			<Control xsi:type="Button" id="msgComposeOpenPaneButton">
				<Label resid="paneComposeButtonLabel" />
				<Supertip>
					<Title resid="paneComposeSuperTipTitle" />
					<Description resid="paneComposeSuperTipDescription" />
				</Supertip>
				<Icon>
					<bt:Image size="16" resid="icon16" />
					<bt:Image size="32" resid="icon32" />
					<bt:Image size="80" resid="icon80" />
				</Icon>
				<Action xsi:type="ShowTaskpane">
					<SourceLocation resid="messageComposeTaskPaneUrl" />
				</Action>
			</Control>
		</Group>
	</OfficeTab>
</ExtensionPoint>
```


> **Info**: If you do not need the read form in your add-in, you best remove the ExtensionPoint for the **MessageReadCommandSurface** type.

The last thing to do is creating the label variable and task pane URL. Add the following highlighted lines of code to your **Resources** element manifest file: lines 10, 17, 18, 22.

```xml
<Resources>
	<bt:Images>
		<bt:Image id="icon16" DefaultValue="~remoteAppUrl/Images/icon16.png"/>
		<bt:Image id="icon32" DefaultValue="~remoteAppUrl/Images/icon32.png"/>
		<bt:Image id="icon80" DefaultValue="~remoteAppUrl/Images/icon80.png"/>
	</bt:Images>
	<bt:Urls>
		<bt:Url id="functionFile" DefaultValue="~remoteAppUrl/Functions/FunctionFile.html"/>
		<bt:Url id="messageReadTaskPaneUrl" DefaultValue="~remoteAppUrl/MessageRead.html"/>
		<bt:Url id="messageComposeTaskPaneUrl" DefaultValue="~remoteAppUrl/ComposeForm/form.html"/>
	</bt:Urls>
	<bt:ShortStrings>
		<bt:String id="groupLabel" DefaultValue="My Add-in Group"/>
		<bt:String id="customTabLabel"  DefaultValue="My Add-in Tab"/>
		<bt:String id="paneReadButtonLabel" DefaultValue="Display all properties"/>
		<bt:String id="paneReadSuperTipTitle" DefaultValue="Get all properties"/>
		<bt:String id="paneComposeButtonLabel" DefaultValue="Compose command"/>
		<bt:String id="paneComposeSuperTipTitle" DefaultValue="Compose command super tip"/>
	</bt:ShortStrings>
	<bt:LongStrings>
		<bt:String id="paneReadSuperTipDescription" DefaultValue="Opens a pane displaying all available properties. This is an example of a button that opens a task pane."/>
		<bt:String id="paneComposeSuperTipDescription" DefaultValue="Compose command super tip description."/>
	</bt:LongStrings>
</Resources>
```

Once this is in place, you can debug the application and you will get an add-in action that opens the compose form task pane in the Outlook 2016 client.
