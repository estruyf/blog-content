If I should describe the SharePoint Saturday Stockholm in one word, I would go for **amazing**.

If you didn't know that it was the first time that this event was organised, you would have said that the team: [Hannah Swain](https://twitter.com/hannahrswain), [Matthias Einig](https://twitter.com/mattein), and [Erwin van Hunen](https://twitter.com/knowsharepoint) did this already a couple of times. Therefore I would like to thank the whole team for having me on this great event, and I also want to thank the volunteers for the help during the event.

## Farewell XSL, Welcome Display Templates

This was my first international speaker engagement, with a full room and a camera pointed at me, I started my presentation. For what I can say it went fine, only had one problem with my demo (off course never during the dry-runs), which eventually was related to a caching problem.

If I didn't test the demo just before the session, everything should have worked perfectly fine. Only an IISRESET was needed to solve it.

Here are my slides:

Thank you all for the honest votes. More feedback is always welcome, so feel free to comment.

## The Defender Challenge: Tobias VS Elio

Probably the biggest challenge that day was playing Defender against Tobias Zimmergren. This challenge was organised by [Tretton37](http://tretton37.com/). All you needed to do was setting your high score in order to win a Kindle.

Eventually I won with about 1000 points more (which is still not that great if you compare it to this guy: [http://elst.es/1e1LL72](http://elst.es/1e1LL72)).
