Since 2019, I have been using the [Shokz](https://shokz.com) (AfterShokz at that time) bone conduction headphones for my solo cycling rides. They were great for listening to music and podcasts on those long rides while still being able to hear the sounds of the road and my surroundings. Unfortunately, they stopped working a few weeks ago, and I had to look for a replacement. I was looking for something that would be as good as the previous model but with some improvements. I found the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2, the latest and "best" model from Shokz.

I have been using the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 for a few weeks now, so I am sharing my thoughts on them.

## Design and comfort

The Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 has a design similar to that of the previous models. It is much slimmer than my AfterShokz. The headphones are lightweight and comfortable for long periods, even when wearing regular or cycling glasses.

I first bought the OpenFit 2 earbuds, but the fit was not great. They felt too loose on my ears, and I was afraid they would fall off during rides, so I traded them in for the OpenRun Pro 2s.

A significant difference from my previous model is the speaker; I have to adjust the headphones less to hear the sound. As the previous model was more focused on bone conduction, the sound quality would drop significantly if they moved a bit too far to the front. The OpenRun Pro 2's keep themselves in place much better, and the "DualPitch" technology, a combination of bone and air conduction, keeps the sound quality high. The sound is a lot more balanced and the bass is a lot better. I can hear the music and podcasts.

### The AfterShokz vs. the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2

## Safety and awareness of your surroundings

A significant advantage of bone conduction headphones is their open-ear design, which allows you to listen to audio while remaining aware of your surroundings. This is crucial for cyclists. I can hear approaching cars or fellow cyclists while enjoying my music or podcasts.

At moderate volume levels, I can also wear them while riding in a group and chatting with other riders. However, this only works when some music is playing in the background.

## Sound quality

It is no surprise that the sound quality is much better than my previous model. The OpenRun Pro 2s have a lot more bass, and the sound is much more balanced. I can hear the music and podcasts clearly, even at higher speeds. The sound is also much clearer and better, which is great for listening to podcasts and audiobooks. The Shokz app also allows you to adjust the EQ settings or use presets. For example, I use the vocal preset when listening to podcasts.

One thing I noticed, as there are currently a lot of windy days, is that listening to podcasts is more difficult with this model. My previous model gave more bone conduction, making hearing the sound easier. On those windy days, the air conduction feature falls short for podcasts. Listening to music is not a problem; you can have it in the background and do not have to focus on it as much. It only occurs when you have the wind in your face; once you have the wind at your back, the sound is a lot better.

## Battery life

The battery life is great for my use. For instance, I completed a 4-hour ride on Saturday and a 3-hour ride on Sunday without recharging, and the headphones still had battery capacity left.

## What I have not tested

### Water resistance

I have not tested the OpenRun Pro 2s in the rain, but they should be resistant to water splashes and sweat. I will update this post if I ever get caught in the rain.

### Microphone

I have not tested the microphone quality because I am not using the headphones for calls. During my rides, I do not want to be distracted by calls. I would only pick up calls from my emergency contacts, and all other calls would be ignored until I was back home.

## Conclusion

After numerous rides with the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2, they've become an essential part of my cycling gear on those solo rides. The Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 is a great upgrade from my previous model. The sound quality is much better, the design is more comfortable, and the battery life is great. The only downside is that the air conduction feature does not work as well on windy days, but I can live with this as I turn on some music instead. 

If you're a cyclist who wants to enjoy audio on the ride safely, the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 is worth considering. It keeps your ears open and your music flowing—a perfect combination for the road. Happy riding, and stay safe!
