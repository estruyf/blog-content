Since 2019 I have been using the [Shokz](https://shokz.com) (AfterShokz at that time) bone conduction headphones for my single cyling rides. They were great for listening to music and podcasts on long rides, while still being able to hear the sounds of the road and my surroundings. Unfortunately, they stopped working a couple of weeks ago and I had to look for a replacement. I was looking for something that would be as good as the previous model, but with some improvements. I found the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2, which is the latest and "best" model from Shokz.

As I have been using the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 for a few weeks now, I wanted to share my thoughts on them.

## Design and comfort

The Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 have a similar design to the previous models. Compared to my AfterShokz, it is a lot slimmer. The headphones are lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods of time, even when you are wearing regular or cycling glasses. 

I first bought the OpenFit 2 earbuds, but the fit was not great. They felt too lose on my ears and was afraid they would fall of during rides, so I traded them in for the OpenRun Pro 2's.
