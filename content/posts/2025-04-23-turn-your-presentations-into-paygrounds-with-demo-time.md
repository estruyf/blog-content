If you've ever given a talk at a conference, you know the drill: prepare your slides, maybe a demo or two, deliver your session, and then share a link to your slidesâ€”and possibly a GitHub repo. But what happens next?

Do attendees actually understand how it all works? Do they remember the key takeaways? Or do they just move on to the next talk, leaving your presentation behind?

These are questions Iâ€™ve been asking myself for years. I've given many talks, and Iâ€™ve seen countless others do the same. The pattern is always the same: even when the audience is engaged during the session, theyâ€™re often left stranded afterward. They might remember the excitement, but they struggle to replicate or apply what theyâ€™ve seen.

## Sharing isnâ€™t enough

Donâ€™t get me wrongâ€”sharing your slides and code is a good start. But itâ€™s not the same as being in the room during the demo. When attendees open your repo later, theyâ€™re forced to guess: *Which file did you edit? What command did you run? What was that output again?*

This is not a great experience, that is why I created [Demo Time](https://demotime.elio.dev).

> Demo Time isnâ€™t just for speakers. Itâ€™s for learners.

## What is Demo Time?

**Demo Time** is a Visual Studio Code extension that turns your technical presentations into fully-scripted, replayable experiences. From within your editor, you can:

- Present slides
- Open and create files
- Highlight specific lines of code
- Run commands or code snippets in the terminal
- And script the entire flow of your presentation

{{< blockquote type="info" text="The above video is an example of what your slides can look like with Demo Time." >}}

Itâ€™s like having a remote control for your demo, without worrying about typos, wrong files, or missing steps.

Since launching Demo Time, Iâ€™ve used it across numerous talksâ€”and so have many other speakers. With all the feedback and iterations, it has evolved into a complete presentation toolkit. Now, not only can you deliver your talk from your editor, but you can also **share the exact experience with your audience afterward**.

## Your talk, their playground

Demo Time gives your audience:

- âœ… **Your presentation** â€” Slides and code walkthroughs, just like they saw during your session.
- âœ… **A real code repository** â€” Ready to clone and explore.
- âœ… **Step-by-step instructions** â€” The exact flow you followed on stage.
- âœ… **A self-paced experience** â€” Let them pause, retry, or dig deeper wherever they want.

Hereâ€™s how it works: you create your presentation using Demo Time, then share the code repository. Attendees can open it in VS Code, launch the Demo Time panel, and walk through the exact same flowâ€”step by step.

> No need for screenshots. No missed steps. No stress.

## A better experience for everyone

When your audience can revisit your talk interactively, theyâ€™ll retain more, try more, and remember more. Theyâ€™ll be able to:

- Explore your demos without fear of breaking things
- Modify the code to fit their own scenarios
- Apply your techniques in their own work

All while focusing 100% on your live sessionâ€”because they know everything will be available to explore later.

> Donâ€™t worry about taking picturesâ€”just clone the repo. This allows your attendees to keep 100% focus on your talk.

## Example of a Demo Time presentation

### Playwright + Power Platform talk

At **Global Power Platform Bootcamp 2025**, I shared a full Demo Time experience. Check it out here: [GitHub: PowerApps + Playwright Presentation](https://github.com/estruyf/presentation-powerapps-playwright).

Just clone the repo, open it in Visual Studio Code, and follow the steps via the Demo Time panel.

### Marc Duiker at KubeCon

Marc Duiker used Demo Time to deliver his [KubeCon Europe 2025](https://marcduiker.dev/articles/speaking-at-kubecon-europe-2025/) talk. His repo includes slides, code, and a complete walkthrough: [GitHub: Dapr Resiliency & Durable Execution](https://github.com/diagrid-labs/dapr-resiliency-and-durable-execution).

Itâ€™s a perfect showcase of how powerful and accessible technical talks can beâ€”with the right tooling.

## Help them learn, not just watch

Tech talks should not end with applause, they should spark action.

**Demo Time** helps your audience go beyond inspiration. It turns passive watching into active learning. Your demo isn not just something they saw, itâ€™s something they can do.
