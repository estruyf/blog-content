    "description": "In this session, we will explore how to use Playwright to automate testing of Microsoft 365 applications. We will focus on how Playwright can be used to create end-to-end tests that verify the behavior of Microsoft 365 applications for Microsoft Teams, and SharePoint. We will discuss how Playwright can be integrated into a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, and how it can be used to catch bugs and regressions before they reach production. Additionally, we will provide tips and best practices for creating effective tests that cover common scenarios in Microsoft 365 applications. By the end of this session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of how to use Playwright to improve the quality of their Microsoft 365 applications.",
