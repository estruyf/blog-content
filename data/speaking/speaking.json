With multi-factor authentication and rapid release cycles in play, the stakes are even higher. In this session, you'll learn how to bring confidence to your releases by implementing robust end-to-end tests using Playwright. We'll cover everything from writing your first test to handling authentication (yes, even MFA), mocking APIs, and integrating it all into a GitHub Actions pipeline. Whether you're a developer, tester, or team lead, you'll walk away with practical strategies, real-world examples, and code samples to help you build a scalable testing setup for the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. If you're serious about quality—and tired of finding bugs in production, then this is the session for you.",
